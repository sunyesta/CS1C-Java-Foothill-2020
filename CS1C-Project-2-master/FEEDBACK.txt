FEEDBACK:

Excellent implementation of the findSubset() method.


+0.5 Excellent implementation of computeSubset() in class SubsetSum incorporating generics
     to work with both inputs.
     

+0.5 Excellent documentation of your source code.


Very good descriptive README.

     
Extra Credit Opportunity:
+1 implementation of findSubset() for SongEntry type.
   How does your implementation improve about the Part 1? The challenge for
   this part was to experiment with being able to handle larger sets.

+1 clearly defined test cases for findSubset() method.   

+1 Successfully finds subset.

-Bita.
