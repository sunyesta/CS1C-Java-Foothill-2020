The curves for each graph each follow a trend where they dip down and reach their lowest points around when the recursion limit is 50 and then go up.
The bumps in the graph are most likely due to my computer processing external things which makes sence because computers are always processing things in the background
whether we know it or not.
To limit this, I tried turning on airplane mode and not using my laptop while it ran its computations.
Because the lowest trend point for time in each of the curves is around 50, I would say that the most optimal recursion limit of quick sort is around 50.
