FEEDBACK:

Overall, well done this quarter!

 
Excellent description of findings.
	Yes, the oscillation/bumps of run times is most likely due to background applications, 
	processes etc. For example, a spike could be due to GC running in the background. 
	Creative approach in switching to "airplane mode" to try to reduce background applicaitons!
	
	Perhaps a Java profiler (such as JProfiler) would help solve the mystery. 


Good annotation of your graphs.


Very good documentation of your implementation.

-Bita.
