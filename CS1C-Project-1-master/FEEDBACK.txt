FEEDBACK:

Congratulations on your first submission!

-0 Do not include the file ".iml" which is an IntelliJ specific configuration file.


-0.5 missing .gitignore file. Result is your binary folder "out" is being committed to repository. 
	See modules on .gitignore and github tutorial. 
	Next time minus one for this.
