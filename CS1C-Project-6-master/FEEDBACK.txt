FEEDBACK:

Very good garbage collection of your LazySearchTree class. You are very close.
   See suggestion below.
   
   
Good submission of additional test cases.

   
-0.5 Incomplete implementation of collectGarbage does not correctly set the root of
     the tree after calling removeHard. Make sure to set the root in public facing
     collectGarbage() method:
        mRoot = collectGarbage(mRoot);
     See sample output below.

calling garbage collection...  <----------------

inventory after garbage collection:
"hard" number of unique items (i.e. mSizeHard) = 1
"soft" number of unique items (i.e. mSize) = 1

Testing traversing "hard" inventory:
bread:0  butter:1  

Testing traversing "soft" inventory:
butter:1
