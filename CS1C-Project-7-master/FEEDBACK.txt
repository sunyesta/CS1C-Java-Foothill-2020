FEEDBACK:

Well done incorporating the annotation @Override to add compile time checks.


Good overloading of hashCode() and compareTo() methods in wrapper 
   classes SongsCompInt and SongsInGenre.
   

-0.5 Missing the toString() method for the wrapper classes with useful 
     information for the client.
   
   
Good testing of the FIND_SONG_BY_ID and the FIND_SONG_BY_GENRE selection.


Nice detailed README clarifying the purpose of each file!

-Bita.
