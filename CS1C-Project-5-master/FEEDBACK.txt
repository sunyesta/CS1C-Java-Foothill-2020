FEEDBACK:

Nice clean implementation of your LazySearchTree class with lazy deletion!


Good documentation of your implementation.


Extra Credit:
+1 Good testing of lazy removal in FoothillTuneStore.
   For future, a broader range of test cases. For example, randomize
   the size of the tree.
   
+2 Excellent testing of findMin() and findMax() in class FoothillTuneStore.

-Bita.
